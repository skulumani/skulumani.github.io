My research is focused on applying geometric mechanics and control to aerospace systems.
In my previous work in the US Air Force, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of research and operational projects.
During my PhD career I have continued this trend and developed theoretical methods for orbital transfers of spacecraft using low-thrust propulsion systems.

### [George Washington University](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/)

* [Low-thrust]({% link _posts/2015-08-10-2015AAS.md %}) [orbital]({% link _posts/2016-08-20-2016AAS.md %}) transfers

    Developed geometric methods to determine low-thrust orbital transfers in the three-body problem and around asteroids.

* [Constrained Attitude Control]({% link _posts/2015-10-09-2016ACC.md %})

    Geometric attitude control for a rigid body which allows for re-orientation while avoiding pointing at obstacles.

* [Estimation]({% link _posts/2016-10-15-2016AAS-B.md %})

    Particle filter techniques which improve space situational awareness.

### [Air Force Research Laboratory](http://www.kirtland.af.mil/Units/AFRL-Space-Vehicles-Directorate/)

* [ANGELS](http://www.kirtland.af.mil/Portals/52/documents/AFD-131204-039.pdf?ver=2016-06-28-105617-297)

    Developed computational tools for performing orbit determination and sensor characterization in support of on-orbit operations.

* Attitude Control testbed
    
    Developed in situ attitude control testbed using the worlds largest air-bearing platform.

* Geolocation using Time Difference of Arrival

    Developed analytical and estimation based methods to enable geolocation of surface based transmissions using constellations of satellites.
