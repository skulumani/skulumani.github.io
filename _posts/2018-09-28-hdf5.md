### Download from [Github](https://github.com/skulumani/fdcl-hdf5)

This is a wrapper library for interfacing Eigen datatypes with the [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) file format. It allows one to easily save/read Eigen data in an open and cross-platform and cross language manner. The overall goal is to emulate `h5py` in easy of use with numpy/Eigen based data.

It currently supports the following:

1. Opening HDF5 Files in read only, read/write, truncate modes
2. Given an HDF5 file create subsequent groups, or datasets
3. Given a group create more subgroups or datasets
4. Read/Write any Eigen variable (currently setup primarily for Eigen::DenseBase objects)

## Installation

This library depends on both `Eigen` and `HDF5` which can be installed using the included scripts.

1. [`build_eigen.sh`]( ./scripts/buid_eigen.sh ) - Install `Eigen` to `/usr/local`
2. [`build_hdf5.sh`]( ./scripts/build_hdf5.sh ) - Build and install `HDF5`
3. [`build_cmake.sh`](./scripts/build_cmake.sh) = Build `cmake` from source

From the source directory:

~~~
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo checkinstall (or make install)
~~~~

Which uses `checkinstall` (`sudo apt-get install checkinstall`) to allow one to easily uninstall

~~~
sudo dpkg -r fdcl-hdf5
~~~

To use the shared library in your own project, execute everything above then add the following to your project `CMakeLists.txt`

~~~
find_package(FDCL_HDF5 REQUIRED)
add_executable(<your_target> <source_files>)
target_link_libraries(<your_target> fdcl_hdf5)
~~~

## Usage

All of the functionality is included in the `HDF5` namespace and is exposed to your program using

~~~
#include "hdf5.hpp"
~~~

There are several different modes for operating on files:

~~~
HDF5::File::ReadOnly; /**< Read only access */
HDF5::File::ReadWrite; /**< ReadWrite access */
HDF5::File::Truncate; /**< Overwrite a file if it exists or create a new one */
HDF5::File::Excl; /**< Only open if the file doesn't exist */
HDF5::File::Create; /**< Create a new file */
~~~

Here is a basic example of reading/writing Eigen matrices.
You can try this yourself using `main`
Look in the `tests` directory for more examples 
~~~
#include "hdf5.hpp"

#include <Eigen/Dense>

#include <iostream>

void write_data() {
    Eigen::MatrixXd matrix(3, 3);
    matrix << 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;

    // open the file 
    HDF5::File hf = HDF5::File("filename.hdf5", HDF5::File::Truncate);

    // write the data
    hf.write("dataset_name", matrix);
    
    std::cout << "Original Matrix: " << std::endl;
    std::cout << matrix << std::endl;
}

void read_data() {
    // open the file for reading
    HDF5::File hf = HDF5::File("filename.hdf5", HDF5::File::ReadOnly);

    Eigen::MatrixXd matrix;

    hf.read("dataset_name", matrix);
    
    std::cout << "Matrix read: " << std::endl;
    std::cout << matrix << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    write_data();
    read_data();
    return 0;
}

## Background

The HDF5 file format offers an efficient and well supported data storage format for large amounts of data.
Tools and libraries are available for a large variety of languages and platforms.

The HDF5 format allows for the following:

* Heterogeneous data storage
* Easy portable sharing across platforms/languages
* Fast input/output with parallel access and data compression
* No limit on data storage
* Self documenting with metadata along with data files
