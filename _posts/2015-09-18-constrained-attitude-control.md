title: "Geometric Adaptive Control of Attitude Dynamics on SO(3) with State Inequality Constraints"
date: 2015-09-17
modified: 2015-09-18
excerpt: "In this recent work, we develop a method to control the attitude dynamics of a rigid body.
          Geometric control techniques are used to design a feedback control law in the presence of state constraints.
          We demonstrate this control schem via numerical simulation and experiments with fixed multi-rotor."

Some pretty plots

Maybe some animations - include a GIF of the satellite rotating
