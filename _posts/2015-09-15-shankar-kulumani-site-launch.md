excerpt: "A place to record my research."

My first attempt at creating a personal website. 
I hope to set this up as a central place to show my work and offer some more detail for those interested.
In addition, it will allow me to make the source code available and easy to find. 

I'm following this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and using the [Hyde template](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).
The entire site is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
