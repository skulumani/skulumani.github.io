## What is CI?

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is a software development practice of frequently commiting source code changes, often several times per day, into a shared pipeline. 
Then, automated tools are used to build and test this code at an accelerated pace. 
This allows for any issues or faults to be identified quickly and therefore be corrected quickly. 
Furthermore, the continual process of merging new work with the exisiting code base ensures that any single person cannot veer too far off course.
This avoids the ``integration hell`` that frequently occurs for large projects.

We can utilize the same concepts for our LaTeX documents and ensure that the manuscripts are consitently able to be built and available for others to view.
The key concepts invovled here are common to any software project and can be readily extended:

1. Version control using [Github](github.com)
2. Continuous Integration using [Travis CI](travis-ci.org)
3. Building/Compiling source code [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) into the end product 

The specifics of version control, continuous integration, or LaTeX are not explained here but might be topics for a future post.

## Setup your repo

First, it's assumed that you already have your manuscript tracked by ``git``, if not you should really start now!

## Setup Travis

## Commit and Build

## Automatic releases on tags

## Other cool things

You can add some cool badges to your repo

## Examples

Most of my work is using this setup. 
This includes both LaTeX documents as well as other software.

Examples of setup:
