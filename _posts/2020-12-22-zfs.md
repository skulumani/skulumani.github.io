ZFS is a file system that supported large amounts of data and has automatic capabilities to prevent data rot and ensure integrity. 
It's not a perfect solution, but I'm now using it to mirror my home backup across several drives. 
This at least gives me another measure of safety for the backup. 
As always, all backups should at a minimum follow the 3-2-1 rules where there are 3 copies of the data, across 2 different types of media, and at least 1 is located off-site. 

1. Install zfs

2. Figure out which drives are installed

3. Create a pool

~~~
ls -la /dev/disk/by-id
sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 -f data $DISK1 $DISK2
~~~
4. Check on the status/information about the pool

5. Replace a drive in the pool

Destroy  `sudo zpool destroy data`
