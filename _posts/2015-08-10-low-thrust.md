## Abstract

A computational approach is developed for the design of continuous low thrust
transfers in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The transfer design
method of invariant manifolds is extended with the addition of continuous low
thrust propulsion. A reachable region is generated and it is used to determine
transfer opportunities, analogous to the intersection of invariant manifolds. The
reachable set is developed on a lower dimensional PoincarÂ´e section and used to
design transfer trajectories. This is solved numerically as a discrete optimal control
problem using a variational integrator. This provides for a geometrically exact
and numerically efficient method for the motion in the three-body problem. A
numerical simulation is provided developing a transfer from a \\(L_1\\) periodic orbit in
the Earth-Moon system to a target orbit about the Moon.
