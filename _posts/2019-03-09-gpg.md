## What is public-key cryptography?

[There](https://github.com/bfrg/gpg-guide) are [many](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html) [guides](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography/Public_Key_Overview) available online which describe the basics of public-key cryptography.
This post will not focus on the basics but rather a specific implementation of using GPG with a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/).
With this approach you'll have your GPG secrets in a portable and secure device which you can then use on any machine.

In short, public-key cryptography is aimed at allowing two parties to securely generate a secret, a secure key, through an insecure communication channel.
In essence, two parties will share some public information, completely in the clear for anyone to see/record, yet they will still arrive at the same secret key!
With this secret key, both parties can then encrypt data and securely pass it between themselves. 

One key assumption with public-key cryptography is that the private portions of this key actually remains secret. 
Due to this, the Yubikey provides an excellent solution.
The Yubikey hardware token provides a secure hardware solution to store OpenPGP keys, and act as a second factor device for many web services. 
With the Yubikey, and GPG, you can securely use your private GPG keys with the knowledge that it is techinically infeasible to remove them from the device.

## Requirements

In order to follow this you'll want the following:

1. A YubiKey 4 or better which supports 4096 bit RSA keys. Ideally buy two of them to have a backup.
2. Two USB drives to create a secure OS (Tails) and backup your GPG keys. This is important because without the backup you will have no way to recover your GPG secret if you lose or damge your Yubikeys.
3. Some time and patience. You'll probably run into problems and will have to debug.

This will basically follow the guide by [drduh](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) with some additional details where I ran into issues.

## Creating your GPG keys securely

One of the main benefits of using a Yubikey is that you can be certain that your private keys are actually secure. 
If you generate all of these "secret" keys on a public or compromised system then none of this stuff really matters. 
For this reason, it makes the most sense to do the following on a secure system, such as [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html).

Follow the instructions and create a secure Tails OS.
You'll essentially download Tails, create a live USB, then boot to this version and create a really secure version of Tails on your second USB drive. 
It's important that the system you use to create your GPG keys is actually secure or it'll defeat the whole point of your Yubikey if someone can just read your private key directly.
If you're really paranoid you could even use Tails on an airgapped machine.

Once you have Tails setup, boot into it and install the following software

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    curl gnupg2 gnupg-agent \
    cryptsetup scdaemon pcscd \
    yubikey-personalization \
    dirmngr \
    secure-delete \
    hopenpgp-tools
~~~

## Creating new GPG keys

Here we'll create brand new keys. 
If you want you could transfer already created keys onto your Tails distribution.
However, by securely creating brand new keys on Tails you can be more sure that the only copy of your private key will exist securely on your Yubikey and your backup.

First we'll create a temporary directory for GPG

~~~
export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d); echo $GNUPGHOME
~~~

Now you can use the hardended GPG settings from [here](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf) or copy the following in `$GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf`

~~~
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256
personal-compress-preferences ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 AES256 AES192 AES ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
cert-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
charset utf-8
fixed-list-mode
no-comments
no-emit-version
keyid-format 0xlong
list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity
with-fingerprint
require-cross-certification
no-symkey-cache
throw-keyids
use-agent
~~~

We'll start by creating a Master Key. 
This Master key should be kept offline at all times and is only used to certify your other keys, namely encryption, signing, and authentication subkeys that will be stored on the Yubikey and used for all other purposes.
In addition, the Master Key will be used to revoke or create new subkeys.

When creating your key you'll be prompted to enter a password. 
Enter a good password and make sure you write it down and store it securely. 
If you forget you'll have to start over.

### Creating the master key

We'll use GPG to create a master key with `Certify` only authority

~~~
gpg --expert --full-gen-key
~~~

1. Select 8: RSA (set your own capabilities)

2. Select E to toggle off the Encrypt capability, which will leave you with only Sign + Certify.

3. Select S to toggle off the Sign capability, which leaves only Certify

4. Set a 4096 bit key size, if you have some specific need you can chose 2048 bit for older hardware

5. No need to set an expiration date for this key

6. Enter your name, email and a comment to setup the UID.

7. Setup a passphrase.

Once the key is generated you should note the `KEYID`

~~~
export KEYID=0x20D0685093466FC7
~~~

which you'll use later

## Create your subkeys

Here we will edit the Master Key to add a number of subkeys

~~~
gpg --expert --edit-key $KEYID
~~~

These subkeys will be loaded onto your Yubikey and used for all the daily purposes.

### Signing subkey

Within gpg

~~~
gpg> addkey
~~~

1. Choose `(4) RSA (sign only)`

2. 4096 bits

3. Set key expiration for 1 year. 
This can be extended later with your master key when required. 
By setting an expiration date you can limit any damage from a compromised subkey.

### Encryption subkey

Now add another key following a similar process

~~~
gpg> addkey
~~~

1. Choose `(6) RSA (encrypt only)`

2. Choose 4096 bits

3. Set the key expiration to 1 year again


### Authentication subkey

Finally we create an authentication only subkey.
GPG doesn't provide a default key for this so we create our own

~~~
gpg> addkey
~~~

1. Choose `(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)` and toggle the options until only `Authenticate` is allowed

2. Choose 4096 bits again

3. Set a 1 year expiration

### Verify the keys

You can verify your keys

~~~
gpg --list-secret-keys
--------------------------------
sec#  rsa4096/0x20D0685093466FC7 2018-10-20 [SC] [expires: 2019-10-21]
      Key fingerprint = 5DC0 E5C9 AD73 DC63 D61D  7445 20D0 6850 9346 6FC7
uid                   [ unknown] Shankar Kulumani (YubiKey) <shanks.k@gmail.com>
ssb>  rsa4096/0x58AA35F282289879 2018-10-20 [S] [expires: 2019-10-21]
ssb>  rsa4096/0x65C3E441CAA89126 2018-10-20 [E] [expires: 2019-10-21]
ssb>  rsa4096/0xABCD933DE083D57D 2018-10-20 [A] [expires: 2019-10-21]
~~~

If you'd like you can add additional emails to your key using the `adduid` command.

### Generate a revocation certificate

It's a good idea to generate a revocation certificate in case GPG didn't do it by default

~~~
gpg --output revocation.asc --gen-revoke $KEYID
~~~

## Backing up your keys

This step is very **IMPORTANT** because once your keys are on the Yubikey it will be impossible to remove. 
Without backing these up if you lose your Yubikey you will lose access to anything secured by your keys!!

First we'll export the GPG keys to an ASCII armored format

~~~
gpg --armor --output private_key.gpg --export-secret-key $KEYID
gpg --armor --output sub_keys.gpg --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID
gpg --armor --output public_key.gpg --export $KEYID
~~~

Take all of these files (private, sub, public, and revocation) and backup them up on a seperate USB drive. 
It's important these files are safe and stored offline. 
Keep them safe with your important documents, such as your passport and birth certificate.

The public key will need to be loaded onto any of your systems and shared with the world. 
Move that to an easily accessible location. 
One option is to upload your public key to [Keybase](https://keybase.io/).
Also consider creating a [paper backup](https://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/)

## Personalizing your Yubikey

The first step is to use GPG to enable the YubiKey to be used as a smartcard.
In addition, we'll change the default and admin PINs on the Yubikey.
The default PIN is used to utilize your keys while the admin PIN is used to unlock the card and perform more critical operations.

Plug in your YubiKey:

~~~
gpg --card-edit
~~~

1. Once in GPG type `admin`
2. Enter `passwd`
3. Follow the prompts to modify the Admin PIN (selection `3`)
4. You can also update `name`, `lang`, `login` and finally type `quit` when finished

## Transfer your keys to the YubiKey

The `keytocard` operation is destructive and will remove the key from your sytem and place it securely onto the YubiKey.
Ensure you have made backups before completing this step.

1. Enter `gpg --edit-key $KEYID` to display your master (certify), signing, encryption, and authentication keys
2. Enter `key 1` to select the Signing key (indicated by a `*`) followed by `keytocard` and select `1` to transfer to the YubiKey
3. Deselect the key using `key 1` and select the next key with `key 2` and then transfer using `keytocard` and pick the appropriate key type
4. Repeat for the authentication key
5. Once all keys are saved enter `save`

Finally  verify the keys on the card using

~~~
gpg --list-secret-keys
~~~

The keys should be indicated by `ssb>` indicating that only a stub exists on the system and the keys are located on the card

~~~
sec#  rsa4096/0x20D0685093466FC7 2018-10-20 [SC] [expires: 2019-10-21]
      Key fingerprint = 5DC0 E5C9 AD73 DC63 D61D  7445 20D0 6850 9346 6FC7
uid                   [ unknown] Shankar Kulumani (YubiKey) <shanks.k@gmail.com>

~~~

### Final steps

You should have already backed up your keys previously.
If not, now is the time to export your public key to share with the world.
You will need this public key on every system you want to use your YubiKey.

~~~
gpg --export --armor $KEYID > /tmp/public_key.gpg
~~~

Make sure you have the following before leaving your Live Image

* Backed up your master key, subkeys, revocation certificate, and public key 
* Saved your YubiKey  PIN
* Saved the password for your master key


## Using your keys

You can reboot into the Live Image, or onto another system to test your keys

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent pcscd curl
~~~

Copy the hardended `gpg.conf` file to your system

~~~
mkdir ~/.gnupg ; curl -o ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf
chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
~~~

Import the public key from your backup

~~~
gpg --import /tmp/public_key.gpg
~~~

Trust the master key (since it's your own key) `gpg --edit-key $KEYID` followed by `trust` and ultimate trust.

Exit using `save`

Insert your Yubikey and enter `gpg --card-status` to see something similar to the following

~~~

The `sec#` means that the master key is not available (since it's stored offline)
If you see something about `none` key info, this means you need to import your public key.

## Basic GPG usage

Here are some examples on how to use your YubiKey

1. Encrypt to yourself

~~~
echo "message" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient $KEYID
~~~

2. Encrypt to multiple recipients, just use multiple `--recipient` flags

~~~
echo "message" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient $KEYID --reciepient $KEYID_1
~~~

If you don't use your own key, you won't be able to later decrypt

3. Decrypt

~~~
cat encrypted_message.txt | gpg --decrypt --armor
~~~

4. Signing a message 

~~~
echo "message signed" | gpg --armor --clearsign --default-key $KEYID
~~~

5. Verify a signature

~~~ 
cat signed_message.txt | gpg --verify
~~~

You should a `Good signature` and if it complains you can set the trust level of your own key.

### Setting up Git to use your GPG keys for SSH access and signing
 
We will use `gpg-agent` to handle keys and use it instead of `ssh-agent`

First download a hardened configuration for `gpg-agent`

~~~ 
curl -o ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg-agent.conf
~~~

or copy the following to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

~~~
use-standard-socket
enable-ssh-support
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-curses
default-cache-ttl 60
max-cache-ttl 120
~~~

Add the following to your shell rc files to utilize `gpg-agent`

~~~
# set gpg stuff
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
unset SSH_AGENT_PID
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
~~~

To use your Yubikey for SSH, copy the following to your servers `authorized_keys` file

~~~
$ ssh-add -L
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA[bunch of random stuff] cardno:000607761351
~~~

It also makes sense to explicitly use this identity for servers you've setup by modifying your `~/.ssh/config` file

First save this identity

~~~
ssh-add -L | grep "cardno:" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
~~~

The modify `~/.ssh/config` to use this identity

~~~
Host github.com
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
~~~

Test your connection:

~~~
ssh git@github.com -vvv
~~~

## Git signing with your YubiKey

Tell Git to use your key

~~~
git config --global user.signingkey $KEYID
~~~

Now sign your commits/tags with the `-S` option which will automatically poll the YubiKey.
Upload the public key to your Github account  to get that sweet verified image:

![Verified]({{ site.url }}/assets/gpg/verified.png)
