Some web widgets from various cycling sites I use. 

## [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3370565)

{% include strava_recent.html %}
{% include strava_summary.html %}

## [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/users/216546)

{% include ride_with_gps_summary.html %}

Look into [tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com/) to keep all of these services synchronized.
