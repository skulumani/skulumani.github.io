## Abstract

This paper presents a new geometric adaptive
control system with state inequality constraints for the attitude
dynamics of a rigid body. The control system is designed
such that the desired attitude is asymptotically stabilized,
while the controlled attitude trajectory avoids undesired regions
defined by an inequality constraint. In addition, we develop
an adaptive update law that enables attitude stabilization in
the presence of unknown disturbances. The attitude dynamics
and the proposed control systems are developed on the special
orthogonal group such that singularities and ambiguities of
other attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and
quaternions are completely avoided. The effectiveness of the
proposed control system is demonstrated through numerical
simulations and experimental results.
