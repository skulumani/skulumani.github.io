## Abstract

This paper presents a new geometric adaptive
control system with state inequality constraints for the attitude
dynamics of a rigid body. The control system is designed
such that the desired attitude is asymptotically stabilized,
while the controlled attitude trajectory avoids undesired regions
defined by an inequality constraint. In addition, we develop
an adaptive update law that enables attitude stabilization in
the presence of unknown disturbances. The attitude dynamics
and the proposed control systems are developed on the special
orthogonal group such that singularities and ambiguities of
other attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and
quaternions are completely avoided. The effectiveness of the
proposed control system is demonstrated through numerical
simulations and experimental results.

## Configuration Error Function

We create a modified configuration error function which utlizes the concept of a barrier function.
This error function quantifies the distance between the curent and desired system configuration.
The error function, \\(\Psi\\) is composed of an attractive term \\( A \\) and a repulsive term \\(B\\).

$$
\begin{align}
\Psi(R, R_d) &= A(R, R_d) B(R) \\
A(R, R_d) &= \frac{1}{2} \tr{G \left( I - R_d^T R\right)} \\ 
B_i(R) &= 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha_i} \ln \left( - \frac{ r^T R^T v_i - \cos \theta_i}{1 + \cos \theta_i}\right) 
\end{align}
$$

We can also extend this easily to any arbitrary number of obstacles by slightly modifying our error function:

$$
\begin{align}
\Psi = A(R) \bracket{1 + \sum_i C_i(R)} \quad C_i = B(R) - 1 .
\end{align}
$$
  
## Control Design

Using [Lyapunov analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_stability) we can design a control input that will ensure that the zero equilibrium is Lyapunov stable.
Applying the control input, \\( u \\), to the system ensures we can stabilize to the desired attitude while avoiding all obstacles.
In addition, we incorporate an adaptive term to handle any uncertainties in the system model.

$$
\begin{align}
u &= - k_R e_R - k_{\Omega} e_{\Omega} + \Omega \times J \Omega - W \bar{\Delta}, \\
\dot{\bar{\Delta}} &= k_\Delta W^T \parenth{ e_\Omega + c e_R } .
\end{align}
$$
