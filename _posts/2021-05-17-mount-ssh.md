When dealing with remote machines, it's common to transfer files using [`scp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol). For example, to copy a local file to a remote host:
 
~~~
scp <path>/<to>/<local file> user@remotehost:<path>/<to>/<remote file>
~~~

This is perfect for single files or directories but sometimes it's useful to have a local mount point for performing file operations. 
Using [`sshfs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS) can mount the remote directory.
You can install following these [directions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh), or on Debian based using

~~~
sudo apt-get install sshfs
~~~

First, create a local directory for a mount point:

~~~
sudo mkdir /tmp/mount_point
~~~

Then mount the remote directory:
~~~
sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions user@remotehost:/<path>/<remote directory> /<path>/<local directory>
~~~

To unmount use:
~~~
sudo umount /<path>/<local mount point>
~~~
