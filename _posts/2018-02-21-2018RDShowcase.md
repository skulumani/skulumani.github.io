## Summary

In order to determine the shape of the asteroid, we model a laser ranging sensor (LIDAR) on a maneuvering spacecraft.
The LIDAR is able to provide depth measurements of the surface of the asteroid.
Given a set of depth measurements it is possible to compute the shape, and hence gravitational potential of the asteroid.
Computing the shape of the asteroid on a continual basis avoids the long delay and computational complexity of current asteroid operations.
Furthermore, the updated gravitational model enables a spacecraft to autonomously transition from a mapping orbit directly to landing.

We develop a method to incrementally update the shape of an asteroid model using LIDAR measurements.
This incremental update occurs in real time and allows for responsive space missions around asteroids.

## Basic procedure

We first begin by simulating LIDAR measurements around an asteroid

Each measurement defines a point that lies on the surface of the asteroid.
Taking many measurements defines a point cloud which represents the surface shape.

The end goal is to define a surface mesh which represents the shape of the asteroid.
