## [C&O Patrol](https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm)
I volunteer to patrol the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath. 
It's a great opportunity to enjoy the trail and go for a bike ride.

## Cross Check
I'm a big fan of Surly and their bikes. 
After several years of putting it off, my wife surprised me with a new Cross Check.

## Panasonic
I also ride a class touring Panasonic for all of the grocery trips.
