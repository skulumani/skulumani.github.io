  abstract            = {This paper presents a new geometric adaptive control system with state inequality constraints for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. The control system is designed such that the desired attitude is asymptotically stabilized, while the controlled attitude trajectory avoids undesired regions defined by an inequality constraint. In addition, we develop an adaptive update law that enables attitude stabilization in the presence of unknown disturbances. The attitude dynamics and the proposed control systems are developed on the special orthogonal group such that singularities and ambiguities of other attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and quaternions are completely avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results.},
