I am a graduate student at the George Washington University in the [Flight Dynamics and Control Laboratory](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/). 


## Contact Information

I can be reached via email at [shanks.k@gmail.com](mailto:shanks.k@gmail.com).


## [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/)

Signal allows for simple and secure commuincations across mobile devices. 
It is available for both Android and iOS and offers encrypted messages and calls. 
It is also [completely open-source](https://github.com/WhisperSystems), available for free and trusted by [security researchers](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/here-come-encryption-apps.html).

## GPG Key

My [GPG](https://keybase.io/skulumani/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=5dc0e5c9ad73dc63d61d744520d0685093466fc7) key is available on [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/skulumani).
With `keybase.io` you can further verify that this key is associated with me since it's also tied to several social media accounts and this domain name.

The key fingerprint is:
