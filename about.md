## Test Latex Code

This is a displayed math equation:

$$
\begin{align}
	J \dot{\Omega} + \hat{\Omega} J \Omega &= u + \Delta \, ,\\
	\dot{R} &= R \hat{\Omega} \, .
\end{align}
$$

Remember to use two dollar signs for displayed equations.

While this, \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), is an inline equation.
