excerpt: "Converting from cantilevers to mini v brakes"
---

Cantilevers allow for a lot of tire/rim clearance

V brakes have much better braking performance, however they require longer pull brake levers.

Using mini v-brakes is supposed to be the best of both worlds and uses short pull levers. 
The pads will run close to the rim and there is not much clearance above the tire for fenders.
