# Residential Locks

The first thing that is typically recommended for any new homeowner is to replace all of the locks. 
While your new home was on the market there was near limitless access to the keys and locks of the home. 
This includes all of the agents, prospective buyers, the previous buyers, etc. 
There is no way to know the number of copies that exist for the existing locks and as a result it is best to simply replace them. 

## Deciding on locks

One doesn't have to replace the entire lock, you can try to rekey, or replace the lock cylinders. 
Assuming the existing locks are already of the style or quality that you desire. 
If that's the case, then you can skip this section and proceed to the following where I describe how to rekey your own locks.

Getting high quality locks doesn't matter if other issues exist:

1. Leaving a door/window open
2. Having windows next to doors that anyone can operate
3. Not physically securing door to frame, kick in protection
4. Simply forgetting to lock the door
