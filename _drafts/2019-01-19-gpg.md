## What is public-key cryptography?

Imagine you would like to share secret information with another party.
To do this, you decide to write your message and store it inside a locked box. 
Now only someone who holds the key to this box can open and read your message. 
You're also now freely able to send your box anywhere safe in the knowledge that no one is able to open the box. 
As long as the other party also has a copy of the key, they will be able to open the box and read the message. 


In short, public-key cryptography solves the age-old problem "how do I communicate with someone securely without somehow exchanging a secret password first?" Exchanging a shared password securely is a hard problem. You may have no way to do so if your communications are monitored.

With public-key encryption, instead of sharing a password, each party generates a "keypair" consisting of a "public" key and a "secret/private" key. Each party can then publish their "public" key to the world or send it directly to the other party, while keeping their secret key private and safe.

If you have Person B's public key, you can do a few things with it:

Encrypt a message that only that Person B can decrypt. (They need their secret key to decrypt it.)
Validate that Person B signed a message with their secret key. This also lets you verify strongly that the message was not corrupted nor modified in transmission.
With your secret key, you can do a few things:

Decrypt messages encrypted with your public key.
Sign messages that others can verify came from you (they need your public key to verify the signature.)
