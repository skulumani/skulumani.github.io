## What is public-key cryptography?

[There](https://github.com/bfrg/gpg-guide) are [many](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html) [guides](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography/Public_Key_Overview) available online which describe the basics of public-key cryptography.
This post will not focus on the basics but rather a specific implementation of using GPG with a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/).
With this approach you'll have your GPG secrets in a portable and secure device which you can then use on any machine.

In short, public-key cryptography is aimed at allowing two parties to securely generate a secret, a secure key, through an insecure communication channel.
In essence, two parties will share some public information, completely in the clear for anyone to see/record, yet they will still arrive at the same secret key!
With this secret key, both parties can then encrypt data and securely pass it between themselves. 

One key assumption with public-key cryptography is that the private portions of this key actually remains secret. 
Due to this, the Yubikey provides an excellent solution.
The Yubikey hardware token provides a secure hardware solution to store OpenPGP keys, and act as a second factor device for many web services. 
With the Yubikey, and GPG, you can securely use your private GPG keys with the knowledge that it is techinically infeasible to remove them from the device.
