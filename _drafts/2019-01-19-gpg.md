## What is public-key cryptography?

Imagine you would like to share secret information with another party.
To do this, you decide to write your message and store it inside a locked box. 
Now only someone who holds the key to this box can open and read your message. 
You're also now freely able to send your box anywhere safe in the knowledge that no one is able to open the box. 
As long as the other party also has a copy of the key, they will be able to open the box and read the message. 

However, now we've simply exchanged one problem for another.
How exactly do we share this secret key without it falling into the wrong hands. 
Also, what happens if the key is lost?
Would this mean we need to get a new locked box?
For example, if I already had a method to secrely share information, why would I need my "locked box", or encryption, in the first place. 

In short, public-key cryptography is aimed at solving this problem.
It allows two parties to securely share a secret key through an insecure communication channel. 
In essence, two parties will share some public information, completely in the clear for anyone to see/record, yet they will still arrive at the same secret key!
We still have the problem of protecting our secret key, but that is a problem for a different time.
