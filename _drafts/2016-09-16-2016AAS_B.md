## Abstract

## Main Idea

This is some work I was able to help with while working as an intern at [Applied Defense Solutions](http://www.applieddefense.com/).
I was lucky to be able to contribute to some of their great work.


Particles better represent uncertainty than other methods

From this discrete set of particles we want to estimate the PDF

Using the PDF we can then generate a variety of useful information quantities

## k-NN algorithm

Show the algorithm

Maybe even copy in the code
