## Predatory publishers

Soon after presenting a conference paper I recieved an email from the [David Publishing Company][dpc]:

```
David Publishing Company  (DPC) (originally as USA-China Business Review (Journal), Inc., USA), founded in 2001, is a professional English-language academic journals and books publisher both in print and online versions, which serves the world's research and scholarly communities.

```

inviting me to submit my paper to their ** Journal of Earth Science and Engineering (JEASE) **.
I was suspicious of the publisher from the moment I read the email as I have never heard of a reputable journal actually soliciting work, especially that of graduate students. 

A few weeks later I received another letter (shown below) further inviting me to submit the paper.

```

This time it is from a different journal and states they __wish to become my friend__. 
After some further research it is clear that ** David Publishing Company ** is a fake operation that is praying upon naive researchers.
They charge upwards of $1000 to publish an article, have no proper review process, and are not recognized in any fashion.
One key litmus test is if you've never read an article from a journal, it's probably not worth spending time to submit.
