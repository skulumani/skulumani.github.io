title: What's Jekyll?
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

## [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Jekyll works best on Linux/Unix, or MacOS. 
It's possible to install on Windows but it's more difficult and prone to error.
This guide assumes you're using MacOS, modify as required.

* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

```shell
 brew install ruby
```

* Install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)

    You may have to manually download it and install if it's something new to your system.

```shell
gem update --system
```

* Install Jekyll

```shell
gem install jekyll
```
